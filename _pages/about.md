I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [DB4AI](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/db4ai/) group at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/) supervised by Professor [Lei Chen](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~leichen/) (ACM Fellow & IEEE Fellow). Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree (2017-2021) from the [School of Automation Engineering](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/info/1015/1409.htm) at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/).

Research Interests
======
I am broadly interested in machine learning, data management, systems, and their intersections. Currently, my research is centered on optimizing inference serving of large language models (LLMs).
